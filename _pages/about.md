As of February 12 I'm a Data Analyst developing and optimizing processes for data analysis, reporting, and visualization. I also teach a university-level data science course, contributing to the professional development of students in the region. My skills include process automation with Python and Power BI, data wrangling to ensure data quality, and statistical and predictive modeling to support decision-making.

My academic background includes a masterâ€™s and doctoral research where I modeled intertemporal economic decisions using neural networks and developed mathematical models of cognitive processes, as well as computer vision and posture tracking algorithms. I collaborated on various interdisciplinary projects, applying mathematical and computational tools to capture patterns in natural phenomena. This experience continues to inspire my work in data science and AI.
